that is attributed to a certain artist.

=head2 WRITE METHODS

These methods write to the database (create/update/delete)

=head2 create

When given a GET request this displays a form allowing the user to enter
data, creating a new artist. If a POST request is received, the data
is validated and if validation succeeds, the artist is entered into the
MusicBrainz database.

The heavy work validating the form and entering data into the database
is done via L<MusicBrainz::Server::Form::Artist>

    }
}

=head2 edit

Allows users to edit the data about this artist.

When viewed with a GET request, the user is displayed a form filled with
the current artist data. When a POST request is received, the data is
validated and if it passed validation is the updated data is entered
into the MusicBrainz database.
