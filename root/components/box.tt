[%#- The box component is used to section of blocks of text and give them a specific header. By using the box component,
     you will also produce a box with a style that is consistent with the rest of the MusicBrainz website.

     You can specify the following variables:

     - color (optional): This can be either 'orange' or 'purple' - and will change the colour of the boxes header.
                         Defaults to 'orange'
     - header: The header of the box
